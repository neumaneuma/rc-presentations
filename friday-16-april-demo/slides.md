- Can you understand what is happening in every line of the code?
  - E.g., what is the value of `x` at line 42?
- What is the state of the running code at any given moment?
- This gets us about halfway up the staircase of understanding

- Can you implement the code yourself?
- Even better, can you implement the code yourself without referring to the original implementation
- This is how we get to the top of the staircase of understanding
